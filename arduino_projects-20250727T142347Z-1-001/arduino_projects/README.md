# üîê Fingerprint-Based Solenoid Lock System

This project is a **biometric security system** that uses a fingerprint sensor to control a **solenoid lock**, developed using an **Arduino Uno**. It allows only authorized fingerprints to unlock the mechanism, making it ideal for lockers, cabinets, and basic access control systems.

## üîå Circuit Connections

| Arduino Pin | Component |
|-------------|-----------|
| D2          | Fingerprint TX |
| D3          | Fingerprint RX |
| D8          | Relay IN |
| D10         | Green LED |
| D11         | Red LED |
| GND / 5V    | Power Lines |

> Note: Use SoftwareSerial library for fingerprint UART communication.

## üß† How It Works

1. On boot, the system checks for enrolled fingerprints.
2. A user places their finger on the scanner.
3. If matched:
   - The green LED lights up.
   - Relay triggers the solenoid lock to open.
4. If unmatched:
   - The red LED lights up.
   - Lock remains engaged.
5. Admin can enroll new fingerprints via Serial Monitor input.
